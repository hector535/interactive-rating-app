## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned the importance of using rem or em units in order to make my design more responsive. I realized that fact when I was working with the rating buttons where these seem smaller whenever I was increasing the browser's font. The issue was caused by a property declared in pixels values.

### Continued development

I am still working to declare my components in a clean way, structure semantically the html and work more organize and less redundant with my css.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me to refresh my CSS custom properties knowledge.
- [Resource 2](https://codepen.io/nwalton3/pen/MWwYMg) - This example helped me to understand the importance of working with em units. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
